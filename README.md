Panopoly Manifest
=================
This repository contains manifest information to be used by the
Repo version control tool - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repo_(script). 

In order to get the latest and greatest from the Panopoly, you need
to install Repo and then run the following commands in your Drupal root:

> repo init -u git://github.com/populist/panopoly_manifest.git

> repo sync

There is a lot of documentation online about Repo, but two of the best
places to look are here:
